Fake Currency Detection Using Logistic Regression

Project Overview
The Fake Currency Detection project aims to develop a machine learning model to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit currency notes. By analyzing various features of the currency notes, the model can help financial institutions and businesses detect counterfeit currency efficiently.

Objectives
1. Develop a Classification Model: Use logistic regression to classify currency notes as genuine or counterfeit.
2. Feature Analysis: Identify and analyze key features that distinguish fake currency from genuine ones.
3. Model Evaluation: Ensure the model is accurate, reliable, and robust in detecting fake currency.

Data Collection
Currency Note Images or Measurements: Data can include images or specific measurements of currency notes.
Features: Common features used in fake currency detection include:
Variance of wavelet transformed image
Skewness of wavelet transformed image
Kurtosis of wavelet transformed image
Entropy of the image

Data Preprocessing
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values and remove any irrelevant information.
Feature Scaling: Normalize features to ensure they are on a similar scale for better model performance.
Label Encoding: Convert categorical labels (genuine or counterfeit) into numerical format for the model.

Logistic Regression Model
Logistic Regression: A linear model used for binary classification tasks. It predicts the probability that a given input belongs to a particular class (genuine or counterfeit in this case).

Implementation Steps
1. Data Collection and Preprocessing:
Gather data on currency notes and preprocess it to clean and normalize the features.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Visualize the data to understand the distribution of features and their relationship with the target variable (genuine or counterfeit).
3. Feature Selection:
Select the most relevant features that contribute significantly to detecting fake currency.
4. Model Training:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the logistic regression model on the training set.
5. Model Evaluation:
Evaluate the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the testing set.
6. Model Tuning:
Adjust hyperparameters and perform cross-validation to improve model performance.
7. Deployment:
Implement the model in a real-world environment where it can be used to detect counterfeit currency notes.
8. Monitoring and Maintenance:
Continuously monitor the model's performance and update it with new data as necessary to maintain accuracy and reliability.

Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy: The proportion of correctly classified currency notes (both genuine and counterfeit).
Precision: The proportion of true positive predictions (genuine notes correctly identified) among all positive predictions.
Recall: The proportion of true positive predictions among all actual positives (genuine notes).
F1-Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between the two.

Expected Outcomes
Accurate Detection: The logistic regression model should accurately distinguish between genuine and counterfeit currency notes.
Feature Insights: Understanding which features are most indicative of counterfeit notes.
Efficiency: Faster and more reliable detection of counterfeit currency, reducing manual inspection efforts.
Scalability: A scalable solution that can be implemented across various financial institutions and businesses to enhance security.
