Fake Currency Detection Using Logistic Regression

Project Overview
The Fake Currency Detection project aims to develop a machine learning model to distinguish between genuine and counterfeit currency notes. By analyzing various features of the currency notes, the model can help financial institutions and businesses detect counterfeit currency efficiently.

Objectives
1. Develop a Classification Model: Use logistic regression to classify currency notes as genuine or counterfeit.
2. Feature Analysis: Identify and analyze key features that distinguish fake currency from genuine ones.
3. Model Evaluation: Ensure the model is accurate, reliable, and robust in detecting fake currency.
